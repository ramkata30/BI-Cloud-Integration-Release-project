# Agenda:
For the deployment of SQL scripts to AWS Redshift, you need to build a GitHub Actions workflow that enables engineers to trigger SQL execution by specifying: 
- A Git branch 
- A SQL file name (or folder of SQL files) 
- Optional execution order if multiple files exist.

# 1. Functional Requirements (Business-Oriented)
SQL Deployment Automation
	Engineers can trigger SQL deployments via GitHub Actions (workflow_dispatch).
	Support execution of a single .sql file or a folder of SQL files.
	Optionally define execution order when multiple files exist.
Branch-Specific Execution
	SQL scripts must execute from the branch specified in the trigger input.
Secure Connectivity to Redshift
	Use GitHub OIDC with IAM Role assumption (no long-lived credentials).
	Optionally fall back to GitHub Secrets for sensitive info (e.g., cluster host).
Error Handling & Reporting
	Stop execution immediately if any SQL file fails (ON_ERROR_STOP=1).
	Provide clear logs for executed SQL scripts and any failures that occur.
Audit & Governance
	Track who triggered the workflow, when, and what SQL was executed.
	Ensure deployments are tied to version-controlled scripts.






# 2. Non-Functional Requirements (Technical Qualities)
# Security
	OIDC federation with IAM Role assumption.
	Least privilege IAM policies (only redshift:GetClusterCredentials, ExecuteStatement).
	Enforce SSL (sslmode=require) for Redshift connections.
# Scalability
	Handle multiple SQL executions in parallel branches.
	Support growing number of engineers and CI/CD runs.
# Reliability & Availability
	Ensure SQL jobs run reliably with retry logic.
	Redshift should be deployed across multiple AZs for fault tolerance.
# Performance
	Optimize SQL execution to avoid long locks or performance degradation.
	Parallelize execution across files when safe (future optimization).
# Governance & Compliance
	Enforce approvals before executing production SQL.
	Maintain audit logs in GitHub and CloudWatch.
# Maintainability
	Workflows should be modular, easy to extend (e.g., rollback support later).
	Documentation for onboarding new engineers.
# Cost Optimization
	Monitor query cost and runtime.
	Optionally use Redshift Serverless for dev/test workloads.
# Operational Excellence
	CI/CD automation with audit trail.
	Rollback strategy via Git revert + redeployment.
	Version-controlled SQL deployments.





# 3. Processes
# Monitoring
	Enable Amazon CloudWatch Logs for Redshift queries.
	Configure Redshift Audit Logging to S3.
	GitHub Actions logs stored per-run for traceability.
	Optional: Integrate with Prometheus + Grafana or Amazon QuickSight for reporting.
# Disaster Recovery
	Automated Redshift Snapshots (daily + on-demand before deployments).
	Store snapshots in cross-region S3 for DR.
	Document SQL rollback procedures (e.g., restore from snapshot, rollback scripts).
# Scalability
	Use Redshift Spectrum or Serverless for scaling workloads.
	Workflow scales horizontally since jobs are isolated per branch.
	Support parallel engineers running independent jobs.
# Upgrades
	GitOps-driven workflow: version-controlled SQL files.
	CI/CD pipeline enhancements (e.g., approvals before prod).
	Use Terraform to manage evolving IAM policies and OIDC configurations.
